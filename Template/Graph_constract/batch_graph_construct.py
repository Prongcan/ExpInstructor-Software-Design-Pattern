        You are a professional academic evaluation experience extraction expert. 
        Please extract detailed and specific knowledge entities and experiential relationships from the following review text to construct an experiential relationship subgraph.
        Knowledge entities include but are not limited to questions, methods, concepts, theories, scenarios, and other professional terms and knowledge. Please do not use a simple word; it is better to enrich the semantic meaning of the entity based on the original evaluation by adding some adjectives. 
        Experience relations refer to, for example, "seems to be relatively good at improving... ability in xxx", "seems unable to be well achieved through... " and other similar evaluative relationship statements. Their characteristics are: they have certain positive or negative emotional evaluation information, and they have as detailed as possible semantic information of specific aspects. Nodes and edges must directly depend on the review. The original text is only for reference. Therefore, when each edge is constructed, there must be corresponding evidence.

        **Entity Naming Guidelines - Be Specific and Contextual:**

        ❌ **WRONG Examples (too generic):**
        - "LLMs" → (It doesn't have to be like this. It depends on the original text specifically.)Might be "scientific reasoning ability of current large language models"
        - "performance" → (It doesn't have to be like this. It depends on the original text specifically.)Might be "few-shot learning ability of current large language models" 
        - "dataset" → (It doesn't have to be like this. It depends on the original text specifically.)Might be "SCIBENCH scientific reasoning evaluation dataset"
        - "method" → (It doesn't have to be like this. It depends on the original text specifically.)Might be "Chain-of-Thought prompting technique"

        ✅ **CORRECT Examples (specific and contextual):**
        - "scientific reasoning ability of current large language models"
        - "few-shot learning performance on complex scientific problems"
        - "SCIBENCH scientific reasoning evaluation dataset"
        - "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique"

        **Relationship Examples - Be Evaluative and Specific:**

        ✅ **Good Relationship Examples:(Include descriptions of both positive and negative aspects and degrees, as well as rich semantic information)**
        - "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting" → "significantly improves" → "calculation skills of LLMs"
        - "SCIBENCH dataset" → "effectively differentiates" → "performance between different large language models"
        - "free-form questions" → "a certain degree prevents" → "result guessing based on multiple-choice answers"
        - "systematic zero-shot example selection" → "can not enhances" → "model's problem-solving capabilities"
        - "Wolfram Language prompts" → "deteriorates" → "few-shot learning performance of LLMs"
        - "random few-shot example selection" → "fails to fully explore" → "potential of few-shot learning"
        - "current LLMs" → "struggles with" → "complex scientific problem-solving tasks"

        ❌ **WRONG Relationship Examples (too generic):**
        - "LLMs" → "is designed to" → "performance" (too vague)
        - "Error analysis" → "requires understanding of" → "Hückel molecular orbital theory" (knowledge relation, not evaluative)

        **Attention**
        1. The evidence section must be complete and no part should be omitted. Never use "...".
        2. Node and Edge should be as specific and detailed as possible, and when combined, they should conform to the logic of the original text.

        You should check the review sentence by sentence to see if there are any evaluations from the reviewers regarding the method or professional terms, and then extract them. And speak out your thinking process aloud. 
        Your final output should be in JSON format:
        ```json
        {{
            "source_name": "node_x", 
            "target_name": "node_y", 
            "relationship": "xxx", 
            "evidence": "relevant sentence from review text(Or the rewritten text in the Node process result)"
        }}
        ```

        Example input: The proposed method cannot demonstrate its effectiveness on both image and audio datasets. And BATTLE can improve the robustness of training agents under adversarial attacks.
        Sample json output (omitting the previous thinking process):
        ```json
        [{{
            "source_name": "PIA", 
            "target_name": "some image and audio datasets", 
            "relationship": "is NOT validated on", 
            "evidence": "The proposed method cannot demonstrate its effectiveness on both image and audio datasets. PS: Based on the paper, the proposed method refer to PIA."
        }},
        {{
            "source_name": "BATTLE", 
            "target_name": "adversarial attacks of agents", 
            "relationship": "enhance the robustness of", 
            "evidence": "And BATTLE can improve the robustness of training agents under adversarial attacks."
        }}]
        ```

        Be specific and detailed !!!!!

        {review_text}
